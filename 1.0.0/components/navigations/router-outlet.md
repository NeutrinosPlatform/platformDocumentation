# router-outlet

## Overview

Paths can be configured for every page in an app using the Routes menu in the left panel. These paths specify how a page can be reached. A page can have child paths. Router Outlet defines the position of a navigated page within a page from where it is navigated. It acts as a placeholder for the navigated page.

## Usage

Router Outlet is used to render a page in a desired location within another page.

### How to use

1. Configure the paths and child paths using “Routes” menu.
2. Drag and drop “Router Outlet” component from the “Navigation” section inside a page’s container where the routed page should be rendered .

### Example

1. Create 2 pages called “home” and “child”.
2. Define a route for the “child” page as a child path of the home component.
3. Create a button component in the "home" page.
4. Set the button’s "routerLink" attribute to “child” page’s path.
5. Drag and drop the “Router Outlet” component from the “Navigation” category in the “home” page container where the routed page \(“child”\) should be rendered. Save the changes.
6. Now, when the button is clicked, the "child" page will be rendered where the "Router Outlet" component was placed in the "home" page.

## Associated Attributes

* **Style:** It accepts a string value and affects the different properties \(height, width, color etc.\) of the component based on the values provided \(eg. background:orange;height:200px;\).
* **Class:** "Class" attribute is used to point to a class in a style sheet. A class contains one or more style statements. Classes are created inside the "Style" tab which is opened by selecting the "Style" side menu. The "Class" attribute accepts space separated class names \(eg. class1 class2\) which are defined in the "Style" tab as shown below.

  ```css
    .class1 {
        border-radius:10px;
        flex-basis:10%;
        height:100px;
    }
    .class2 {
