# raised-button

## Overview

The raised-button component represents a clickable button. The button appears raised compared to a normal button component.

## Usage

Raised-button provides the user a simple way to trigger an event, like searching for a query in a search engine, or to interact with dialog boxes, like confirming an action. It can be used to represent the importance of a specific functionality that is performed on click of this button.

### How to use

1. Drag and drop the component. 
2. Double click the component to display the list of attributes that can be used with it.
3. Fill the attributes which are needed and save the page.

### Example

1. Input the component field\(s\) with the attribute value\(s\):

    `buttonname = submit`

    `Click = clickEvent()` 

    In the "Ts" file write the following function:

   ```typescript
    clickEvent() { 
        alert("Button clicked!!!");
    }
   ```

2. Save it and run.
3. When the page is loaded the value "buttonname = submit" will be the name of the button that will be displayed on the button and "click = clickEvent\(\)" is the event that runs when the button is pressed. On clicking the button, the alert message "Button clicked!!!" will be displayed.
