## Overview

Cards component are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Cards support a wide variety of content including images, text, actions and more.

Now drag and drop a card-image component inside the card below the card-title and in imgSrc field set the path of the image which is stored in assets folder, so the path can be assets:\android\wallpaper.jpg. So the wallpaper image will be loaded. 4. To give some information \(block of text\) about the image drag and drop a paragraph tag inside the container below the card-image, and provide a information in the text attribute. 5. Save and Run the code. 6. A card with a title as Blog, a wallpaper image, and some block of text will be displayed on the screen.

* **Class:** "Class" attribute is used to point to a class in a style sheet. A class contains one or more style statements. Classes are created inside the "Style" tab which is opened by selecting the "Style" side menu. The "Class" attribute accepts space separated class names \(eg. class1 class2\) which are defined in the "Style" tab as shown below.

  ```css
    .class1 {
