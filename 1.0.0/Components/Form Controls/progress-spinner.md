## Overview
Progress spinner component is a circular indicator of progress and activity.

## Usage
A progress spinner is a graphical element which is used to show the loading of a process or an activity. The progress spinner keeps spinning until the specified activity is completed.

### How to use   
1. Drag and drop the component. 
2. Double click the component to display the list of attributes that can be used with it.
3. Fill the attributes which are needed and save the page.

### Example 
1. Input the component field(s) with the attribute value(s):
    ``` 
    strokewidth = 100
    mode = determinate
    ```
2. Save it and run.
3. When the page is loaded the "strokewidth = 100" will be the size of the progress spinner component that will be displayed and "mode = determinate" is the mode in which the progress spinner is displayed.
