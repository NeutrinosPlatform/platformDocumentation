## Overview 
Button toggle component is used to toggle between on/off. When the button is clicked it will be activated and when the button is clicked again the button will be deactivated.

## Usage
A toggle is a specialized control which has the ability to be selected. It is used to activate button on/off.

### How to use   
1. Drag and drop the component. 
2. Double click the component to display the list of attributes that can be used with it.
3. Fill the attributes which are needed and save the page.

### Example 
1. Input the component field(s) with the attribute value(s):
    ``` 
    Class = toggle
    buttonname = on/off
    ```
2. Save it and run.
3. When the page is loaded "class = toggle" attribute will assign the class name as toggle, which can be used to point to a class in a style sheet. The "buttonname = on/off" attribute is the name given to the button that is displayed when the page is loaded.

## Associated Attributes
