## Overview 
A list component contains a number of list-items components and it forms a list. Basically a list component is a container that stores list items. There will not be any layout for list component.
## Usage 
List component contains number of list-item components, in this there is no requirement to set the number of columns, it can be anything. It is a unordered list, and the list items will come one below the other. 
## How to use
1. Drag and drop a list-component.
2. Set the attribute such as style and class. 
3. Now various list-items component can be inserted inside the list-component.

### Example
**Display a list of three items** 
1. Drag and drop a list-component and set the attribute such as style and class.
2. Drag and drop a list-items component inside the list-component. And for the list-items set the attribute such as style, class, *ngFor and label.
3. *ngFor is used to iterate through the object and access the items of the objects, so if folders is a object which has attribute as name(name of folder) which is a string, and there are three items in the folder object. So set the field in ngFor as let folder of folders.
4. Label attribute give the name which will be displayed as a list items, so provide the name as (folder .name), this will access the folders object and get the name value from that. So if the folders object contains three values such as photos, work and document, then the list will be generated which contains the list items as photos, work and document.
5. Save and run, a list will three items will be displayed.

## Associated Attributes 
- **Style:** It accepts a string value and affects the different properties (height, width, color etc.) of the component based on the values provided (eg. background:orange;height:200px;).
- **Class:** "Class" attribute is used to point to a class in a style sheet. A class contains one or more style statements. Classes are created inside the "Style" tab which is opened by selecting the "Style" side menu. The "Class" attribute accepts space separated class names (eg. class1 class2) which are defined in the "Style" tab as shown below.
    ```css
    .class1 {
        border-radius:10px;
        flex-basis:10%;
        height:100px;
