# Ngx Charts

The components in this section allows you to create dynamic and interactive charts using the **`d3.js`** library.

Ngx Charts are unique as they use Angular to render and animate SVG elements. They use the **`d3.js`** library to perform math functions, and calculate scales, axis, and shape generators.
