# Templates

Neutrinos Platform provides you with multiple templates which are coded by experts. You can use these templates to speed up your front-end web development. 

Templates are written in HTML. They consist of HTML, CSS, and directives contained in just one file. Neutrinos Studio combines the template with information from the model and controller to render the dynamic view that a user sees in the browser.
