# Form Controls

You use the Form controls section to create a form in a page.

You can design the form by dragging and dropping multiple components such as check boxes, radio buttons, menus, etc. Each component collects information from users, in ways that go from text lines to file uploads, through options, dates, passwords and many more. When the app is rendered, the users fill the form with data and submit it back to the server in order to let the processing agent administrate the gathered information.
